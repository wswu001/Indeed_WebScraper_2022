Your entire life you’ve been naturally curious about why things work, and other processes fail miserably.  Does this sound familiar?  You’ve watched the Empire Strikes Back 10 times for one reason: to figure out why the Millennium Falcon is a “hunk of junk”, to draft an improved operating system, and email George Lucas how make the Kessel Run in not 12, but 10 parsecs.  At the drive through you break down why some restaurants get you a Royale with Cheese in 10 minutes and then promptly share your results with the manager of McClown’s.  At the baggage claim you dream about riding the conveyor belt through the rubber curtain to take a peek behind the scenes.  You trust you remember your spouse’s birthday but are compelled to verify the date. You review his birth certificate, look through the mail to see if he received a Happy Birthday card from his insurance agent, and yes, consult your mother-in-law.  If that describes you...  Then you are obviously a Business Analyst that’s great at your job. But are you feeling restless in your current job?
